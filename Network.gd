# PROPERTIES -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- #

# A MultiplayerPeer implementation that should be passed to
# MultiplayerAPI.multiplayer_peer after being initialized as either a client,
# server, or mesh. Events can then be handled by connecting to MultiplayerAPI
# signals. See ENetConnection for more information on the ENet library wrapper.

# Note: ENet only uses UDP, not TCP. When forwarding the server port to make
# your server accessible on the public Internet, you only need to forward the
# server port in UDP. You can use the UPNP class to try to forward the server
# port automatically when starting the server.

# Emitted when this MultiplayerAPI's multiplayer_peer successfully
